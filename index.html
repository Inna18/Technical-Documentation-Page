                <p>Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Java has been one of the most popular programming languages for many years.</li>
                    <li>Java is Object Oriented. However, it is not considered as pure object-oriented as it provides
                        support for primitive data types (like int, char, etc)</li>
                    <li>The Java codes are first compiled into byte code (machine-independent code). Then the byte code
                        runs on <b>Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</b> regardless of the underlying architecture.</li>
                    <li>Java syntax is similar to C/C++. But Java does not provide low-level programming functionalities
                        like pointers. Also, Java codes are always written in the form of classes and objects.</li>
                    <li>Java is used in all kinds of applications like Mobile Applications (Android is Java-based),
                        desktop applications, web applications, client-server applications, enterprise applications, and
                        many more.</li>
                    <li>When compared with C++, Java codes are generally more maintainable because Java does not allow
                        many things which may lead to bad/inefficient programming if used incorrectly. For example,
                        non-primitives are always references in Java. So we cannot pass large objects (like we can do in
                        C++) to functions, we always pass references in Java. One more example, since there are no
                        pointers, bad memory access is also not possible.</li>
                    <li>When compared with Python, Java kind of fits between C++ and Python. The programs are written in
                        Java typically run faster than corresponding Python programs and slower than C++. Like C++, Java
                        does static type checking, but Python does not.
                    </li>

                <p>A Java program is a collection of objects, and these objects communicate through method calls to each
                    other to work together. Here is a brief discussion on the Classes and Objects, Method, Instance
                    variables, syntax, and semantics of Java.</p>
                <p><b>Basic terminologies in Java</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Class:</b> The class is a blueprint (plan) of the instance of a class (object). It can be
                        defined as a template which describes the data and behaviour associated with its instance.</li>
                    <li><b>Object:</b> The object is an instance of a class. It is an entity which has behaviour and
                        state.</li>
                    <li><b>Method:</b> The behaviour of an object is the method.</li>
                    <li><b>Instance variables:</b> Every object has its own unique set of instance variables. The state
                        of an object is generally created by the values that are assigned to these instance variables.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <code>
                    public class Main { <br>
                    public static void main (String[] args) { <br>

                    </li>
                    <li><b>Source File Name.</b> The name of a source file should exactly match the public class name
                        with the extension of .java. The name of the file can be a different name if it does not have
                        any public class. Assume you have a public class GFG.</li>
                    <li><b>Case Sensitivity.</b> Java is a case-sensitive language, which means that the identifiers AB,
                        Ab, aB, and ab are different in Java.</li>

                            <li>If several words are used to form the name of the class, each inner word’s first letter
                                should be in Uppercase. Underscores are allowed, but not recommended. Also allowed are
                                numbers and currency symbols, although the latter are also discouraged because the are
                                used for a special purpose (for inner and anonymous classes).</li>

                    </li>
                    <li><b>public static void main(String [] args).</b> The method main() is the main entry point into a
                        Java program; this is where the processing starts. Also allowed is the signature public static
                        void main(String… args).</li>

                <header>Data types in Java</header>
                <p>Java is <b>statically typed and also a strongly typed language</b> because, in Java, each type of
                    data (such as integer, character, hexadecimal, packed decimal, and so forth) is predefined as part
                    of the programming language and all constants or variables defined for a given program must be
                    described with one of the data types.</p>
                <p><b>Java has two categories of data:</b> </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Primitive Data Type:</b> such as boolean, char, int, short, byte, long, float, and double
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Non-Primitive Data Type or Object Data type:</b> such as String, Array, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Types of Primitive Datatypes</h3>
                <p>There are <b>8 primitive data types.</b> These are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>boolean:</b> boolean data type represents only one bit of information either true or false,
                        but the size of the boolean data type is virtual machine-dependent. Values of type boolean are
                        not converted implicitly or explicitly (with casts) to any other type. But the programmer can
                        easily write conversion code.</li>
                    <li><b>byte:</b> The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two’s complement integer. The byte data type
                        is useful for saving memory in large arrays.</li>
                    <li><b>short:</b> The short data type is a 16-bit signed two’s complement integer. Similar to byte,
                        use a short to save memory in large arrays, in situations where the memory savings actually
                        matters.</li>
                    <li><b>long:</b> The long data type is a 64-bit two’s complement integer.</li>
                    <li><b>float:</b> The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point. Use a
                        float (instead of double) if you need to save memory in large arrays of floating-point numbers.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>double:</b> The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point. For
                        decimal values, this data type is generally the default choice.</li>
                    <li><b>char:</b> The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Non-Primitive Data Type or Reference Data Types</h3>
                <p>The <b>Reference Data Types</b> will contain a memory address of variable values because the
                    reference types won’t store the variable value directly in memory. They are strings, objects,
                    arrays, etc.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Class:</b> A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
                        It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. In
                        general, class declarations can include these components, in order: </li>
                    <li><b>Object:</b> It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents real-life
                        entities. A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking
                        methods. </li>
                    <li><b>Interface:</b> Like a class, an interface can have methods and variables, but the methods
                        declared in an interface are by default abstract (only method signature, nobody). </li>
                    <li><b>Array:</b> An array is a group of like-typed variables that are referred to by a common name.
                        Arrays in Java work differently than they do in C/C++.</li>
                </ol>

                <header>Variables in Java</header>
                <p><b>Variable in Java</b> is a data container that saves the data values during Java program execution.
                    Every variable is assigned a data type that designates the type and quantity of value it can hold.
                    Variable is a memory location name of the data.</p>
                <p>A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.</li>
                    <li>A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable
                        effects that memory location.</li>
                    <li>In Java, all the variables must be declared before use.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><b>Types of Variables in Java</b></p>
                <p>Now let us discuss different types of variables which are listed as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Local Variables</li>
                    <li>Instance Variables</li>
                    <li>Static Variables</li>

            <section class="main-section" id="OOP_Concepts:_Inheritance">
                <header>OOP Concepts: Inheritance</header>
                <p>Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP(Object-Oriented Programming). It is the mechanism in java
                    by which one class is allowed to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class.</p>
                <p><b>Important terminology:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Super Class:</b> The class whose features are inherited is known as superclass(or a base
                        class or a parent class).</li>
                    <li><b>Sub Class:</b> The class that inherits the other class is known as a subclass(or a derived
                        class, extended class, or child class). The subclass can add its own fields and methods in
                        addition to the superclass fields and methods.</li>
                    <li><b>Reusability:</b> Inheritance supports the concept of “reusability”, i.e. when we want to
                        create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that we want, we
                        can derive our new class from the existing class. By doing this, we are reusing the fields and
                        methods of the existing class.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><b>Types of Inheritance in Java</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Single Inheritance:</b> In single inheritance, subclasses inherit the features of one
                        superclass. In the image below, class A serves as a base class for the derived class B.</li>
                    <li><b>Multilevel Inheritance:</b> In Multilevel Inheritance, a derived class will be inheriting a
                        base class and as well as the derived class also act as the base class to other class. In the
                        below image, class A serves as a base class for the derived class B, which in turn serves as a
                        base class for the derived class C. In Java, a class cannot directly access the grandparent’s
                        members.</li>
                    <li><b>Hierarchical Inheritance:</b> In Hierarchical Inheritance, one class serves as a superclass
                        (base class) for more than one subclass. In the below image, class A serves as a base class for
                        the derived class B, C and D.</li>
                    <li><b>Multiple Inheritance (Through Interfaces):</b> In Multiple inheritances, one class can have
                        more than one superclass and inherit features from all parent classes. Please note that Java
                        does not support multiple inheritances with classes. In java, we can achieve multiple
                        inheritances only through Interfaces. In the image below, Class C is derived from interface A
                        and B.</li>
                </ol>

            <section class="main-section" id="OOP_Concepts:_Encapsulation">
                <header>OOP Concepts: Encapsulation</header>
                <p>Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that
                    binds together code and the data it manipulates. Another way to think about encapsulation is, it is
                    a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.</p>
                <p><b>Advantages of Encapsulation:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Data Hiding:</b> The user will have no idea about the inner implementation of the class. It
                        will not be visible to the user how the class is storing values in the variables. The user will
                        only know that we are passing the values to a setter method and variables are getting
                        initialized with that value.</li>
                    <li><b>Increased Flexibility:</b> We can make the variables of the class read-only or write-only
                        depending on our requirement. If we wish to make the variables read-only then we have to omit
                        the setter methods like setName(), setAge(), etc. from the above program or if we wish to make
                        the variables as write-only then we have to omit the get methods like getName(), getAge(), etc.

                <p>The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the
                    ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.</p>

                <p>Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the
                    user. The trivial or the non-essentials units are not displayed to the user. Ex: A car is viewed as
                    a car rather than its individual components.</p>
                <p>In java, abstraction is achieved by interfaces and abstract classes. We can achieve 100% abstraction
                    using interfaces.</p>
                <p><b>Abstract classes and Abstract methods:</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>An abstract class is a class that is declared with an <em>abstract keyword</em>.</li>
                    <li>An abstract method is a method that is declared without implementation.</li>
                    <li>An abstract class may or may not have all abstract methods. Some of them can be concrete methods
                    </li>
                    <li>A method defined abstract must always be redefined in the subclass, thus making
                        <em>overriding</em> compulsory OR either make the subclass itself abstract.</li>
                    <li>Any class that contains one or more abstract methods must also be declared with an abstract
                        keyword.</li>
                    <li>There can be no object of an abstract class. That is, an abstract class can not be directly
                        instantiated with the <em>new operator</em>.</li>
                    <li>An abstract class can have parameterized constructors and the default constructor is always
                        present in an abstract class.</li>
